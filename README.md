Movie Recommendation
Movie recommendations thrive on a comprehensive understanding of viewer preferences, achieved by merging varied datasets and employing web scraping techniques. This multifaceted approach involves collecting movie data encompassing genres, directors, ratings, and more from sources like IMDb, TMDb, and streaming platforms, alongside scraping user reviews and sentiments from platforms like Rotten Tomatoes and social media outlets. The integration of these datasets allows for a holistic view, enabling analyses such as genre popularity across demographics, the impact of actors/directors on a film's success, trends in movie preferences over time, and comparisons between user and critic ratings. Utilizing web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy helps extract diverse data, complying with ethical considerations and legal frameworks. By amalgamating datasets and leveraging web scraping insights, this approach not only facilitates personalized recommendations but also unveils valuable insights into evolving viewer preferences and film reception dynamics.
